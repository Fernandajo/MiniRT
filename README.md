# 42-MiniRT

MiniRT is a Project focused on learning the fundamental aspects of raytracing and computer graphics.
With the use of minilibx, we're to develop a program that renders a set scene by raytracing.
Each scene can have a Camera, Objects and Lighting with each varying aspects of their own.

In my Program, raytracing will be achieved by generating numerous rays from the camera to the scene.
