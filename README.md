# 42-MiniRT

MiniRT is a Project focused on learning the fundamental aspects of raytracing and computer graphics.
With the use of minilibx, we're to develop a program that renders a set scene by raytracing.
Each scene can have a Camera, Objects and Lighting with each varying aspects of their own.

# TO-DO

*	Implement the camera and light ray generation.
	*	Fix new_ray.origin to be set from point of impact on last iteration
	*	Adjust return values
*	Check and fix any issues with intersection functions
*	Check the Parser for any issues.
