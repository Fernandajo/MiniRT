# 42-MiniRT

MiniRT is a Project focused on learning the fundamental aspects of raytracing and computer graphics.
With the use of minilibx, we're to develop a program that renders a set scene by raytracing.
Each scene can have a Camera, Objects and Lighting with each varying aspects of their own.

# TO-DO
*	REMOVE TERNARY OPERATOR!!!
*	Convert every object struct into a single struct and add indentifiers
*	Implement the camera and light ray generation.
	*	Make a cone projection calculator thingy?
	*	Shoot rays using cone angles from each pixel
	*	Make find_path() function for finding intersections for the passed in ray
	*	Finish respective intersections for each object
*	Check the Parser for any issues.
